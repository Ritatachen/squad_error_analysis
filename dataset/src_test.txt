He is incapable of telling a lie .
He banged his knee .
Your idea is ridiculous .
He goes to school on foot .
Are you guys OK ?
Do you think you could make a little less noise ?
He made an abrupt departure .
My favorite sport is soccer .
My house is in the suburbs .
Let me explain why .
He will defeat them .
I might be wrong .
Spiders scare me .
Shouldn t you overlook his indiscretions and forgive him ?
At the party , everybody was well dressed .
We have yellow apples .
Have something to eat .
I just wanted to ask you a few questions .
You can t smoke here .
You seem to be in love .

She plans to stay at the Oriental Hotel .
I didn t know that Tom couldn t speak French at all .
What has Tom done ?
Did Tom go to college ?
She kept me waiting for minutes .
Give me something to write with .
Your suggestion seems reasonable .
He s likely to pass the entrance examination .
She did it on purpose .
Tom always drinks coffee in the morning .
She furnished the room with beautiful furniture .
As a matter of fact , bankruptcy is inevitable .
They nodded to each other .
I m likely going to find some way to do that .
The sky is getting dark .
Did you expect something else to happen ?
I had a neighbor who was blind .
If he had stayed at home that day , he would not have met with disaster .
It started a chain reaction .
Tom could ve hurt me worse .
Brave people feel fear , but that doesn t stop them .
What else do you need ?
I enjoyed talking with you .
Do you have your passport ?
Come on inside .
They didn t change their minds .
I m not good at French .
Make a bundle of these clothes .
Have you ever pruned a tree ?
I m excited to see what Tom does .
I can t feel at home in a hotel .
You re the only person I know who doesn t knock before entering my office .
He will never break his promise .
Tom will be here only a few days .
Tom is very ingenious .
Are you all ready ?
I don t think I could stand to spend six hours alone with you .
Tom hid under the bed .
Tom nearly fell off his chair .
He is as tall as his father .
A fool always believes that it is the others who are fools .
My friend frowned as she read the letter .
Give me a sheet of paper .
I ve wanted to ask you out for a long time .
Tom needs a ladder .
Please turn off the radio .
I ll go .
He s gone into hiding .
What re we waiting for ?
It s a wonder they re still awake .
Tom nodded his agreement .
I d just like to ask Tom one question .
He did not hesitate in taking his share of the money .
I love French coffee .
Look at this large map of America .
He is afraid of death .
His English is not bad , seeing that he has studied for only two years .
Today is not your lucky day .
I ve heard rumors .
You are wanted on the phone .
I don t really know you .
Tom has a sore back .
Tom s novel has been translated into French .
I know how old Tom is .
Tom should have told Mary right away that he wasn t single .
Your question is illogical .
Stop being so naive .
I think the soup needs a bit of salt .
My friend is studying Korean .
Can you wait about an hour ?
Get it out of the house .
We re going to buy ourselves a car .
Something doesn t make sense here .

You re under arrest .
He insulted me in public .
I am so busy that I don t watch TV .
We have four French classes a week .
Eight years ago , we were in the early stages of what would become the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes .
I m coming to Boston .
This is our friend Tom .
I won an award as well .
You re defenseless .
We left nothing to chance .
The company laid off five people .
Tom knows Mary is wrong .
Your car is fast .
Tokyo is bigger than Yokohama .
No way !
I just wanted to help the team .
I can be more aggressive if you d like .
Nothing is the matter with the car . It s just that you are a bad driver .
The evidence was against me .
Do it yourself .
He preferred working to doing nothing .
At first , I mistook you for your brother .
I was asked to show my passport at the border .
The teacher allowed him to go home .
I am coming today .
I wasn t fired . I quit .
I can t get used to Tom .
We ought to be ready for whatever comes .
Do you happen to know what time it is ?
Please hold on .
I ve also considered that possibility .
Where have you been all this time ?
I m stuck in Boston .
I kept my mouth shut .

I have a much better idea .
She is not a nurse , but a doctor .
I gave her just what she needed .
No way !
A beam of sunlight came through the clouds .
Tom doesn t feel like eating anything right now .
Sales have decreased these days .
I think we should buy a new house .
Look at that house .
It was an unfortunate mistake .
I have to paint it .
The girl screamed when she saw the flames .
If you have time , drop me a line now and then .
I ll call you at seven .
My father does not like the heat of summer .
It seems like Tom wants to talk to you .
Don t be a backseat driver .
I ll come back to Australia the day after tomorrow .
I ll buy a Ford .
I am tired of reading .
We re moving .
Somebody has broken this dish .
Would you like to have a cup of coffee ?
What s your favorite alcoholic beverage ?

Why should we trust you ?
Tom is traveling by himself .
You don t have to work so hard .
Tom kept silent about his crime for years .
Are you Tom ?
Life without love has no meaning at all .
Tom is asking questions to the teacher .
I ll call Tom tomorrow .
I persuaded him to give himself up to the police .
The crowd calmed down .
I don t know what it sounds like .
I have to stay in bed all day .
Have you finished eating ?
You don t like Tom very much , do you ?
Tom doesn t have time to talk to you now .
I always knew that one day this would happen .
I realized that cats can see in the dark .
I know that girl .
I hope you ll be comfortable here .
We re halfway through .
I want a small bunch of grapes .
Even Tom was baffled .

It s nice to be alone .
My cousin is a junkie .
I m looking forward to next season .

In preparation for painting a portrait , my friend takes many photographs in order to study the subject closely .
Stay away from me .
I am single .
We re waiting for the shop to open .
Let s meet in front of the theater .
Maybe you ll succeed .
There was no taxi , so I had to walk home .
Can any of this be true ?
I felt very lonely .
Adolescents often quarrel with their parents .
I wish I were rich .
It took me five hours to finish the work .
Do you believe in extraterrestrials ?
He is still angry .
Can you please help me ?
Stop trying .
I ll make you some coffee .
Tom can t play the tin whistle very well .
He was poor and couldn t buy a coat .
Tom can t see a thing without his glasses .
Tom knew Mary wasn t at home .
Tom jumped over the fence .

I m opposed to any type of war .
See what the problem is , OK ?
He is Ethiopian .
Lend me some books to read .
We eat many kinds of food .
I ll let you know when we come to the station .
This costs nothing .
She is not only intelligent but beautiful .
Put a mark on this page .
Tom would ve done it already if he knew how .
Tom asked for a loan from Mary .
The man was ashamed of being born poor .
I bought a book about animals .

I was just in the shower .
I am very sorry to inform you that she died .

A tear rolled down her cheek .
They kidnapped me .
I want one !
Is it comfortable to travel by ship ?
I put on my favorite dress for the party .
We sat together in silence for some time .
I think it s time for me to buy a decent camera .
I made a really big sandwich .
Would you like me to repeat the question ?
Take the keys to your brother .

Tom and Mary are happy .
Would you like to eat lunch together ?
Is your school in this town ?
What s your favorite summer activity ?

They claim they re Canadians .
I sometimes use scissors as a can opener .
Did you get me anything ?

He has a Japanese car .
It seems to me that this is too expensive .

We weren t doing anything !
I have a great life .
Tom is extremely busy now .

Someone has to tell Tom what happened to Mary .
Don t compare yourself with your brother because he s a better man than you .
She cooks very well .

He lives in the southern part of the city .
She is Canadian .
You do not realize how important health is until you get sick .
It was a new book .

Why didn t Tom stop ?
I have decided to retire .
It s my last offer .
Stay out of my way .

It was such an interesting book that I read it in a day .
Tom is patient .
Can I see your license , please ?
The capital city of the Netherlands is Amsterdam .
Tom seemed to have something on his mind .
I can t understand what he is trying to say .

It kept raining for three days .
I still have no idea what I m going to say to Tom .
I thought the movie was awesome .
Each time I see this picture , I remember my father .

Do you still want to talk to me ?
Typhus is a contagious disease .

Unfortunately , my father isn t at home .
I want to change the world .
They re making too much noise . I can t concentrate .
How do you write your last name ?
How much more money do we need ?
It was easy to answer .
That ll help .
That girl s eyes are blue .
Tom said he had to work on Saturday .
Tom is an electrical engineer .
I am ashamed of my son s conduct .
I didn t buy anything at that store .
You must quit drinking .
I remember very clearly that he threw two pistols into the river .
We never stood a chance .
I m happy to be able to help you .
Tom wants me to take a picture of his new car .
It was just a shot in the dark .
Tom tried to stop Mary from talking to John .
Could you wrap them up separately ?
She scolded him for being late .
Who s the captain of this ship ?
Could you please wait until I m finished ?
It s on the table .
Let s get on with the meeting .
Tom thought Mary was hiding something from him .
Get to the point !
We sometimes swim in the lake .
We ll let you know the result within a week .
I like French food very much .
Ask Tom if he voted .
Let them take care of themselves .
I m sorry , I don t have change .
Eleven is a prime number .
Do you have an umbrella I could borrow ?
You should not speak ill of others .
You can t blame him .
I ordered those books from Germany .
Boston is beautiful .
Tom doesn t know how to swim .
Try to do better in the future .
I thought we would be more comfortable here .
You should have attended the meeting in person .
I was following orders .
Tom had his key dangling around his neck on a chain .
If you need me , call .
I know Tom misses you .
It is already a little late for that .
She composed herself before speaking .
He can t take care of himself .
Please bring the others .
Yesterday was cloudy .
Do you have any tickets left ?

This isn t sugar .
Tom sat down next to his daughter .
I m not obligated to do that .
There s hardly any water in the bucket .
This is the most beautiful sunset that I have ever seen .
Have some .
He sat there with his eyes closed .
They made me go there alone .
Did you like your first class ?
He is what is called a self made man .
She advised him to go on a strict diet .
I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
Tom has no enemies .
Tom was just trying to help .
Tom took a sip of his drink and put the glass back on the table .
I can t go in there .
The burglar shut the child in the closet .
Get some rest .
There are a few books in the bag .
Everyone ate the same thing .
A carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide pollution that we produce as a result of our activities . Some people try to reduce their carbon footprint because they are concerned about climate change .

You can come in if and only if you know our password .
I always wondered what that noise was .
I was in Canada then .
I find that it s typical for him to come too late .
My work here is done .
It was very beautiful .
This book will be printed next year .
I don t think they re teachers .
Mary can t come . She has to take care of her daughter .
I cannot tell you how to pronounce this word .
Just hang in there .
I need to leave a message .
That s true , too .
I can still help you .
The older she grew , the more beautiful she become .
We re not accusing you of anything .
Where should we go ?
Do you want this guitar ?
Do you have professional experience ?
Don t throw anything away .
Tom didn t know for certain how much the new computer would cost .
Hey , wait for me .
I studied for a while this afternoon .
If there is a big earthquake , the alarm will sound .
Tom is able to speak French .
Tom has a close relationship with Mary .
We have to stop him from drinking any more .
She took her ring off and threw it at him .
Hold your position .
Tom seems happy .
Mary used to dream about getting married .
I have the solution .
I ll text you when I m done .
Just take one .
My mother has a driver s license , but she doesn t drive a car .
Are you still mad at me ? No , not at all .

You know me .
Tom gave up hope .
You must answer these questions .
You ve got a black eye .
They went fishing yesterday .
My luggage got lost .
I hated Tom .
She was born in America .
The fact that I m here proves that I m innocent .
He is so aggressive that others avoid him .
I didn t want to catch a cold , so I didn t go skiing .
May I speak to you ?
Do you want to kiss me ?
I have to solve this problem .
This is how I cook fish .
Tom can t believe Mary let herself get caught .
His mother died when he was eleven years old .
Mary is my niece .
Tom cut Mary s picture out of the magazine .
This song sounds sad .
She wants him to be just a friend .
This time I ll try it .
It was getting late .
What does he expect ?
Do I have to make a speech ?
You re my enemy .
Say what you want to say .
We ll play it by ear .
Two weeks have passed and I haven t seen you .
I think I ll come back soon .
I was invited to the party .
I want to eat something good .
You have three cars .
Tom asked Mary many questions that she couldn t answer .
You had better not take such a hopeless view of life .
Don t smile .

In my room , there are no clocks .
What is your favorite TV program ?
Who told you I was talking about you ?
Terrific !

Tom knew everything .
Don t blame me for your mistakes .

Please repeat after me .
All men are equal before God .
Do you translate lyrics ?
The noise gets on my nerves .
Did you like it ?
Will it be sunny tomorrow ?
I don t want to do his work for him .
It s green .
Do you like to study ?
I ll be ready in a few moments .
I assumed we d all do this together .
Where can I wash my hands ?
This is the house where my uncle lives .
He went to India by way of Japan .
Do you play the piano ?
I assume you ll be explaining why all this is necessary .
Give me a piece of chalk .
Let me see . There were fifteen people .
Ladies and gentlemen , due to an accident at the airport , our arrival will be delayed .
I m not ready for that .
He didn t believe it at first .
He has several buyers for the property .

Quit acting like a child .

It is interesting for me to read my old diary .
James Madison hated the idea .
I ve done some things I m not proud of .
The rumor spread throughout the country .
Tom is in shock .
Give us what we want .
I don t have any feelings for Tom at all .
Here , take this .
They have their own troubles .
I m the only person who knows where Tom is .
There is a good chance of success .
He s not the right man for you .
Nothing can stop them .
He showed her the way .
Tom was a great teammate .
He isn t coming , either .
Tom appears to be winning .
Life is enjoyable .
You have to push that door to open it .
Tom is a witness .
Tom asked his girlfriend to pardon him for forgetting her birthday .
Tom approves .
He almost died .
I remember you .
You ve walked into a trap .
We expected you at .
You re the same age as my girlfriend .
These are my pencils .
They loved you .
This is the hottest summer we have had in fifty years .
The answer is complicated .
Tom devoted his life to helping the poor .
Tom blew out the candles on his birthday cake .
Tom caught Mary stealing money from the cash register .
How about a beer ?
Tom certainly didn t deserve the punishment he received .
Seven is said to be a lucky number .
He resembles his grandfather .
Look at this picture , please .
I d like to see them again .
What a country !
When was the last time you made a cake ?
This book is sold here .
There have been a lot of complaints recently about drivers not obeying the speed limits in downtown Boston .
As soon as I can get the chance , I ll help your mother paint the fence .
If I have time , I ll do it .
Tom didn t require medical treatment .
I hate myself .
She looks unhappy .
We ought to help each other .
I thought that Tom was dead .
Many people do this .
He published the book about the history of coins .
Tom shouldn t have made Mary angry .
You re my enemy .
The schedule dictates that this work be done by the weekend .
They aren t mine .
This museum isn t open on Mondays .
I don t think it s going to happen today .
He insulted me without reason .
From the viewpoint of health , Tokyo is not such a good place to live .
Tom won t interfere .
Excuse me for being late .
He must have missed the train .
Aren t you afraid of me ?
She s alive ! She was drowning , but her father saved her .
Let s wait until Monday .
I have to go to sleep .
Where are the girls ?
Who are your enemies ?
I live at Midvale Drive .
No one pays attention to anything Tom says anymore .
He speaks as if he were an expert .
Your face is familiar to me .
Why are you telling me all this ?
I wish you every success .
We can pay cash .
The arrow indicates the way to go .
It seems that Tom has been here .
I m saving up to buy a new car .
Is Tom really Canadian ?
I understood Tom s point of view .
Let s take a train .
Mastering English is difficult .
Tom doesn t have a clue .
This size doesn t fit me .
The wall is two meters thick .
We didn t have much trouble .
When did you immigrate to our country ?
Be careful not to wake Tom up .
We should not resort to violence .
He made it .
Are you sending Christmas cards this year ?
He fell for the oldest trick in the book .
There s somebody I want you to meet .
Tom doesn t have to pay anything .
Tom showed Mary a picture of John and another boy .
Prove it to me .
I think Tom is going to win .
You ve got to give up gambling once and for all .
He started learning English at the age of eleven .
Oh , I got it .
My friends call me Tom .
Who gave you permission to do this ?
I have a black and a white dog .
I m calling you .
It would be unethical for me to tell you about Tom s medical problems .
The atomic number for iron is .
The dog is beautiful .
You won t finish today if you just sit there .
I ll have to tell my boss that I won t be in tomorrow .
Don t you get bored when you re alone ?
What will you do when you grow up ?
Tom did his homework in the kitchen .
That program is broadcast every other week .
The place is apparently deserted .
I am good at speaking English .
I moved .
Stop talking loudly .
Do you like bowling ?
I m not rich , nor do I wish to be .
Are you good at tennis ?
Why do you want to know that ?
When did you come back from Boston ?
The boy carved his name in the tree .
Those peasants badly need land to grow rice .
You want me to do your dirty work for you , don t you ?
I was able to swim faster when I was younger .
He went abroad to study English .
I don t know what we will do .
You need to take responsibility for what you ve done .
You were having fun , weren t you ?
His son trembled with fear .
We will run short of oil some day .
I had nothing to do with that incident .
A helicopter is able to take off and land straight up and down .
Tom didn t go to school .
Tom looks like he s a bit tired .
I need glasses to read .
I m nervous .
How much money does Tom need to borrow ?
You won t be in time for school .
My father does not always walk to work .
We spent the whole evening talking to them .
A dog jumped onto the chair and lay motionless for five minutes .
Tom hasn t told us his opinion yet .
Tom came all the way from Boston .
I will go to the university tomorrow , too .
These rules are reasonable .
I m sure that Tom will be pleased to hear that .
I don t get sick very often .
I managed to find his office .
Weren t you relaxed ?
The richer he became , the more he wanted .
He offered his help to us .
If you can t explain it easily , you don t yet understand it .
Have you ever been to Tokyo ?
I m looking forward to seeing you dance .
By the time you came back , I d already left .
I don t do things like that .
Last night , he studied all night long .
If you teach me your language , I can teach you mine .
Keep away from me .
He thinks he is somebody , but really he is nobody .
No one s listening .
This bus will take you to the airport .
Tom doesn t mind swimming in the rain .
I hope she will get well .
Tom isn t a liar .
Wait until your father gets home .
Tom told the dog to stay .
I will start after he comes .
Let s build something .
What did they hit you with ?
What time is it ? It is ten thirty .
Can I go outside ?
My dad is the best dad in the world .
Are you absolutely sure you want to sell your father s guitar ?
She said to herself , I am very happy .
Can you help me a little ?
What does Tom think about this ?
I almost forgot to tell Tom about the party .
Next Monday is a holiday .
The horse chafed at the bit put in its mouth .
The buildings are small in comparison to the skyscrapers in New York .
They came to our aid at once .
Tom told Mary what had happened .
My son is taller than me .
Tom refused to even consider my suggestion .
What a selfish woman !
Write it down here , please .
I m not lucky .
You read my mind .
Who teaches you French ?
That s what people don t understand .
It was an oversight .
Tom should ve hired a better lawyer .
We talked without the aid of an interpreter .
She came to Japan as a child .
We ordered pink , but we received blue .
I don t understand why you want it .
I have orders .
The king took his clothes off .
What do you want from Tom ?
If you re tired , why don t you go to sleep ? Because if I go to sleep now I will wake up too early .
Tom is handsome .
Seize the moment .
This book is a whodunit .
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee .
You put in too much pepper .
This is , strictly speaking , a mistake .
I ll call you as soon as I know .
That was a big mistake .
Hunting is forbidden now .
I m going back to Boston . I ve had enough of Chicago .
Blend the red paint with the blue paint .
Will you tell me the truth ?
It wasn t Tom who left the water running .
I discovered the truth .
Tom doesn t like girls who wear a lot of makeup .
Make your move .
I stayed in bed all day instead of going to work .
May I leave a message ?
They demoted you .
Why should I believe that ?
He dropped to his knees .
I don t like to cook when it s hot outside .
I have misjudged you .
Tom has a natural talent .
Tom didn t mean to do that .
I don t believe Atlantis ever existed .
She expressed her thanks for the present .
Tom wants to know where you ve hidden the key .
Tom doesn t want to answer Mary s message .
I hate that idea .
She advised him to lose weight .
She doesn t like soccer .
I have to be home tonight before it gets dark .
I have a dog .
I apologize for the delay in sending the agenda .
We did not get your letter until yesterday .
I have the afternoon off today , so I plan to go to the park , sit under a tree and read a book .
Those houses are years old .
This knife is not sharp enough .
I missed the bus .
Tom wants me to go to Boston with him to visit Mary .
My bicycle was stolen .
May I trouble you to pass me the salt ?
I want to talk to Tom .
I want to go back .
It s not as simple as all that .
Hi ! How are you ?
That house is big .
I took a picture of my family .
Tom doesn t have a sister .
I love tapioca pudding .
She worked for several hours .
I didn t come here for Tom .
Take what you want .
This place is great .
I m very relaxed .
Tom disappeared without a trace .
Can I borrow your pen ?
She and I have been married years .
Children are afraid of me .
She left for Paris .
I ve rented an apartment .
Tom has lost his focus .
This book sells well .
Anticipating a cold winter , we bought a bigger stove .
You should relax a little .
Has he finished his homework yet ?
You can t stop progress .
I heard that Tom is going to turn himself in to the police .
I can t go , nor do I want to .
In our park , we have a nice slide for children to play on .
I d like to reconfirm my reservation .
Apply in writing .
We heard gunfire .
I talk to myself .
My socks aren t here .
Tom isn t in his office .
Eat slowly .
Do you have any foreign books ?
He became sad when he found out .
He s waiting for you at home .
If it were not raining , I would go fishing .
See you in three weeks .
The library will issue you a library card .
Please say yes .
On Sunday , I go to church .
Tom denied the accusation .
Tom always leaves everything to the last minute .
I really have to go .
I am quite comfortable in this room .
I ll sleep here .
Liquor is not sold at this store .
She held her head up bravely .
Tom invited us to his summer cottage .
Part of the story is true .
It is two o clock in the morning .
How many times have you gone there ?
Tom did it on his own .
Maybe they are happy .
It s still early .
Let s play chess another time .
Tom should tell Mary the truth .
Did Tom say anything ?
Tom doesn t take very good care of his children .
It s not natural .
Someday you ll regret this .
There were no schools for the deaf at that time .
It s better to chill white wine before you serve it .
He likes to sing in the bathtub .
The man kept talking for an hour .
Tom asked Mary to marry him .
I d like to make a reservation to play golf tomorrow .
I want to speak with Tom now .
My mother gets up earlier than anyone else .
Who doesn t know such a simple proverb ?
It doesn t seem possible , does it ?
It was light enough .
Tom asked Mary to watch the children .
I d love to meet Tom .
That is my overcoat .
I know how that goes .
She makes excellent meals in the blink of an eye .
Tom believes that the rich deserve to be rich and that the poor deserve to be poor .
Get on the horse .
Something happened here , but I don t know what .
It s an excellent solution .
Don t believe people who claim that they know everything .
I prefer dogs .
There may be others .
Why are you in such a hurry ?
I can t tell you where Tom lives .
She takes care of my children .
A big bomb fell , and a great many people lost their lives .
Having nothing to do , I watched television .
He is wearing glasses .
Tom drinks .
We have to go by the rules .
That s not interesting .
He usually fed his dog cheap dog food .
Tom sees things .
We are accustomed to wearing shoes .
There were several accidents caused by the fog .
What a surprise !
He stepped on my foot on purpose .
Tom doesn t know when Mary will be here .
She accused me of stealing her money .
I remember everything you tell me .
They are facing financial problems .
He s in danger .
My little brother ran through the living room stark naked .
Am I mistaken ?
The experiment seemed to be going well .
Let me get your coat .
You need this .
If you hurry up , you will be in time .
She s also a beauty .
Hang on .
It is a little cold .
Please give me a little more time .
I m not short .
I can be very persistent .
Which club do you belong to ?
I just haven t had a chance .
Your help will save us a lot of work .
It was so cold that no one wanted to go outside .
Does he still have that book he borrowed from the library ?
Do you have Stevie Wonder s new album ?
January is usually the coldest month .
I m going to see her tomorrow .
Taste this .
All of a sudden , the enemy bombs came down on us like rain .
Do you want my help ?
I decided to study abroad .
He kicked his shoes off without untying them first .
Bush studied the problem .
I m living in Boston .
Stop interfering .
Why don t you seem as happy as I am ?
Let s hurry up .
There are many old temples in Kyoto .
I wish I had asked you for advice .
I wish you success in your work .
He has quite a few valuable paintings .
Why should Tom want to help Mary ?
I didn t do anything .
Tom needs to update his website .
It s difficult to help people who can t admit they need help .
Put it on .
I wanted Mary to go out with me instead of Tom .
I don t put sugar in my coffee .
Don t promise anything .
Please don t take pictures here .
You re interrupting me .
That girl resembles her mother .
I can t believe I m really here .
It has been raining since last Monday .
Are you saying my life is in danger ?
I spoke French to Tom .
We re winning .
I would never question his honesty .
He handed the salesclerk the money .
Tom is a very good looking guy .
This building has floors and apartments .
I like having friends in every country .
The price of meat will soon come down .
Tokyo will run short of water again this summer .
Is Tom taller than Mary ?
Can she play the guitar ?
Tom hates everybody .
I was just wondering if Tom could possibly be in love with Mary .
Nobody supported her .
I am pretty sure .
All the English teachers at my son s school are native speakers .
Why did I not know this ?
Where s the nearest art gallery ?
We go to school to learn .
I leave in the morning .
Where is the post office ?
Is that you ?
Where did you take your jeans off ?
Do you really want to go ?
You do not have a fever .
I don t know what Mary is looking for .
I didn t ask to be chosen .
Tom seems to be unwilling to tell Mary what happened .
Short skirts are already out of fashion .
Be a man .
It makes me really happy that you re here .
Life begins when we realize who we really are .
Why do you want that anyway ?
He was paralyzed by fear .
The party will be held outdoors , weather permitting .
He is flying to Paris tomorrow .
I have a brother .
He works in the lab .
Tom will never believe that .
I would like to drastically decrease the amount of time it takes me to clean the house .
I guess you were right .
How much does he earn in a month ?
Tom makes great burgers .
I ll be OK .
I d like to send this postcard to Japan .
I ll go on my own .
Are you by yourself or with someone ?
Tom tried to reach Mary .
I don t like to go outside when it s raining .
Tom saw us .
You ve already had breakfast , haven t you ?
You must sell it .
They are not coming today .
I don t think his story is true .
She revealed her secret to us .
We ve been talking about this for hours . Can we just drop it ?
Since I got married , I ve quit working .
The squeaking of the door gets on my nerves .
Davis did not want civil war .
I will go , provided the weather is clear .
I ve never forgotten you .
She has a bad reputation .
It doesn t look good at all .
How long have you been teaching English ?
Tom doesn t have any cash .
I didn t know about it until I read the paper .
I said I d buy you a drink , so here .
I sat down and opened my notebook .
You look sleepy .
Tom likes the idea as well .
Your bike is better than mine .
What did you answer ?
I m interested .
He was the first person to arrive .
They botched that autopsy .
They often go on picnics by bicycle .
I m going on vacation next week .
I found this restaurant by chance .
The sisters are both blondes .
Tom doesn t think anybody else wants to come .
It was nothing but the shadow of a tall tree .
You can park behind the hotel .
He always conceals his intentions .
Very young children don t know many words .
Do you know how to get there ?
Since the climate here is very mild , it seldom snows here even in the winter .
I want to know who gave you that .
We will have to get over the feeling of helplessness .
You re the only one who bought it .
Stand up for yourself .
Do you still want to go to Boston ?
How many firemen were there ?
She s stubborn .
Compare your answers with the teacher s .
Please come again two weeks from today .
Do you think Tom is guilty ?
Can you teach me English ?
He s a tycoon .
She told me once and for all that she did not want to see me again .
I can t help myself anymore .
We are using a new process to make butter .
We have considered your proposal , and we have decided that we are not able to reduce the price .
His success delighted his parents .
He was run over and killed .
I ll see you guys Monday .
Tom has been tasered three times .
I m not adventurous .
Do you have something in mind ?
Tom and I live together .
We ll see Tom next week .
These clothes are finally dry .
Almost no one believed her .
Pretty much everyone is doing the same thing .
I hope I can see you soon .
I felt sorry for the boy .
I m looking for an old man .
There s something under the bed .
I know very little about him .
He asked a very good question .
Tom is the man of my dreams .
Tom looked very tired when he got home .
Who were you expecting ?
Tom has siblings .
She went to the mall with her friends .
We just gave up too soon .
I haven t asked Tom .
They intend to get married tomorrow .
What kind of sports do you do ?
I don t think Tom is being honest .
Give me my bag .
Tom wouldn t approve .
I know what s happening .
I felt I owed Tom an explanation .
I returned to my hometown after five years absence .
Why are you so tired today ?
Where did you decide to go ?
I cut my finger peeling potatoes .
I have a slight fever today .
We ll stay here until Monday .
Each of them sang a song .
Onions cook more quickly than potatoes .
I ve got a feeling that Tom won t graduate this year .
We re OK .
I am as sad and lonely as can be .
He s the one , isn t he ?
She shot a gun .
I arrived later than usual .
I think I ll sleep well tonight .
Keep searching .
I don t want to give Tom my key .
I run ten kilometers a day .
You should ve rejected such an unfair proposal .
I m surprised to hear you say that .
Should I be jealous ?
They quarreled .
I haven t seen you in three years .
It s quite good .
I m glad you got back .
I live in Milan .
Basically , I agree with your opinion .
They felt sure of success .
I saw that film , but it wasn t very good .
I think you ll be pleasantly surprised .
His next two books were novels .
This bridge is built of stone .
Tom will be busy tomorrow morning .
Tom punched Mary .
Tom has three uncles .
She is like a mother to me .
The floor was covered with dust .
Can I help you ?
Does someone here speak French ?
They first met on a summer afternoon .
What time will you be back ?
It s our car .
Tell her that I am repairing the refrigerator .
It s beyond me .
Summer is my favorite season .
He turned pale at the news .
I m waiting for you to leave .
That watch is less expensive than this one .
Tom just got dumped .
She walks .
If I d had time to do that , I would ve .
Can you help me move the table ?
Tom must be very proud .
Tom is acting a little strange .
I wish we could go back home .
I go to work by car every day .
I don t remember when I first met him .
Is this a river ?
He will be studying when you get up .
Tom doesn t have a criminal record .
I only ask out of curiosity .
I saw the film and found it interesting .
We re making progress .
She wanted a piece of cake , but there was none left .
Tom had a hunch that Mary had spent the day reading comic books .
Put your hand over your mouth when you cough , sneeze or yawn .
Your attendance isn t necessary .
I m a little busy here .
What s on the menu tonight ?
The cause of the accident is still not clear .
Where is your house ? It is over there .
I thought I d forgotten to close the windows .
She doesn t want to play with her toys .
She called for help .
It s perfectly understandable .
Tom was caught in a lie .
I m unnecessary here .
I think it s highly unlikely that Tom will swim .
I write letters which I never send .
My dream is to be a firefighter .
I haven t eaten lunch yet .
I hope I don t lose .
Tom is taller than his father .
I ve got one like that already .
What do you want for your birthday ?
This is a picture of my sister .
Isn t the answer easy ?
If I were you , I would stay quiet .
She always speaks to him in a loud voice .
We have plenty of time to eat .
Don t count on Tom s help .
What color is Tom s hair ?
The mic is yours .
To tell the truth , this is how it happened .
Stay where you are .
Everything s under control .
Who s your favorite historical person ?
You should avail yourself of every opportunity to learn .
This is Tom s book .
Rules are rules .
Was Tom here when it happened ?
Where s a mirror ?
You re useless .
It s a little cold today .
I know that Tom was baffled by that .
I m studying several languages .
I think you should change your eating habits .
I don t have the key .
You look younger than Tom .
Tell me when to stop .
Tom seems like an idiot .
Can we afford a new car ?
Tom is a very close friend of mine .
He devoted his life to education .
I m reading a book about languages .
Tom unlocked the front door .
He is a director , and should be treated as such .
Remove your hat .
Tom couldn t find what he was looking for .
The dog is walking around the table .
Mary showed me the letter .
Tom s here .
I need to see Tom immediately .
We didn t want any trouble .
There s a pay phone over there .
The cat scared me .
I d like to study in Paris .
I am curious .
Man is the only animal that talks .
Why won t my dog eat dog food ?
Bad drivers should have their licenses taken away from them .
Tom remembered the last time he had hugged Mary .
I think I d like to be a better student .
We ll check on it right now .
Why did Tom come back ?
I spent two hours yesterday trying to fix that broken radio .
Can t you get in touch with Tom ?
Tom said that he wanted to learn French .
The store closes at eleven .
No one agreed with him .
Can I take a day off ?
Can I get you a coffee ?
Try to make good use of your time .
Tom uses anabolic steroids .
We need money to do anything .
I need to get out of this place .
My answer matches yours .
He knows how to pluck a chicken .
He enjoys a good social life .
He was born in Nagasaki .
Forget him .
Are you sure we can t repair this camera ?
I think it won t rain this afternoon .
It was warm , so I opened the window .
Because of the problem of air pollution , the bicycle may some day replace the automobile .
Tom seems to have something on his mind .
She traveled all over the world .
Do not watch television .
Where did you find the key ?
Tom took out a pencil and started to write .
He wanted to know more about the trees , too .
He gave her a book .
That doesn t ring a bell .
He is an able lawyer .
The rules are simple .
I think it s clearing up .
I lost my watch .
Don t go against his wishes .
He still writes poems .
I ve learned how to relax .
It took them some time to get used to one another .
Did he stay very long ?
I ll try to do my best .
I eat only when I m hungry .
There is nothing to do , so I may as well go to bed .
It s finished now .
Tom is a lot stronger than Mary .
We re Canadians .
Tom hates raw onions .
