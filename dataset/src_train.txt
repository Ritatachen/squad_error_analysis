Tom knew that Mary couldn t be trusted .
I want to go to bed .
Who do you think was watching TV in this room last night ?
Tom has too much work to do .
She looked after my children last night .
It s hidden under the bed .
Our city is getting bigger and bigger .
Where should I put this ?

This piece doesn t match .
Tom asked Mary where she usually went shopping .
I try to eat a balanced diet .
What did your wife say ?
Have you read this book already ?

That s rather amusing .
She was superstitious , as the people of that period usually were .
I think the pay is enough .
His manners aren t those of a gentleman .
Tom went back to his room .
You must be hiding something .
They are all college students .
The manager suggested that I go with him to the airport .
She has just turned twelve .
Are you usually early or late ?
You should get up early .
Tom said he didn t feel tired .
Anyone can do that .
She broke the dish on purpose just to show her anger .
Dinner will be ready soon .
I think we are in agreement .
Is that a request or an order ?
I don t want you to treat me any differently .

I m going to buy a pack of cigarettes .
I d like to spend a few days with Tom .
What would you do in my place ?
Do you believe in such things ?
I wonder if Mary knows how much I love her .
He is nothing more than a coward .
You really shouldn t use pirated software .
He loves his daughter , but his wife doesn t .
How did Tom get home ?
He stood against the wall with his hands in his pockets .
It appears to me that we misunderstand him .

As far as I know , he is not married .
Don t touch anything .

He thinks that s normal .
Don t touch that button !
His unique perspective helped shed light on the situation .
Delete that picture .
This is no good .
Am I speaking too quickly ?

He could do nothing but watch .

There s nothing to be afraid of .
Tom thinks that sports are a waste of time .
Do you enjoy living like this ?
You hurt me , Tom .
In everyday life we have many obligations and responsibilities .
Tom wondered whether Mary was happy with how John had handled the situation .
I feel great about this .
A strange car was parked in front of my house .
I d like to be a millionaire .
Although she lives nearby , I rarely see her .
I don t know how old Tom is now .
It s snowing .
You re very brave , aren t you ?

I d like to see him tomorrow afternoon .
The woman who is sitting on the sofa is my grandmother .
The climate s very mild .
She s a woman now .
I didn t think he would come .
He does not believe in evolution .
Tom gave Mary something cold to drink .

I can t budge it .
Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday .
It couldn t have come at a better time .
I was lucky that I was able to find a good babysitter .
Let s do what Tom said .
A look of contentment appeared on his face .
We didn t see any girls in the group .
I guess our teacher is over fifty years old .
You shouldn t keep them waiting so long .
Who ran ?
This woman definitely knows that she doesn t know what she wants .
Are you having a good time ?
The lecture was really boring .
Let s do this again . It s been a lot of fun .
Please read the meter .
Tom used to be demanding .
He is very mean to me .

The ground floor was flooded .
Tom likes brunettes .
Your Chinese is awesome already .
It s night .
There s someone inside .
The meeting lasted two hours .
The hill was all covered with snow .
There s no need to set the table . We re going out to eat .
I can barely stand his behavior .
The sole survivor of the crash was a baby .
I ran out of fuel .
Jump .
I hope you have fun .
Watch us .
He looks as if he could not even harm a fly .
I am not a student .
Would you like to be considered for the job ?
Tom needed Mary .
My youngest brother was brought up by our grandmother .
Let it rest , Tom .

Nothing is more important than empathy .
He keeps two cats .

Our world is only a tiny part of the universe .
She insulted him .
I miss you , Tom .
As far as I know , there were no problems during the first semester .
Don t do a half baked job .
Half the students were absent .
I was drenched to the skin because of the heavy rain .
I have seen her before .
He turned the doorknob with his left hand .
Tom finished his coffee and left for work .
What if you re wrong ?
Garlic is used to improve the taste of food .
Reading is one of life s great pleasures .
All I want for Christmas is a new tattoo .
Scientists will come up with new methods of increasing the world s food supply .
I ll join you later .
Nowadays coffee is scarce .
You need to pay extra for the batteries .
You may choose one of them .
I guess I can t blame you .
The hole is big enough .
I know Tom from work .
Have you seen my glasses anywhere ?
Mary wanted to finish making breakfast before Tom woke up .
Tom was grounded for three weeks .
He deserves more .
Why do you have to do it ?
Many dog owners only feed their dogs once a day .
What a cute girl !
I want to learn .
Do they live with you ?
I will be the cook tonight .
She loves cats .
The boy spilled the ink , but he didn t mean to .
I haven t yet met anyone I d want to spend the rest of my life with .
Tom is a juvenile delinquent .
It s the perfect number .
There are many good reasons not to do it .
Let s do the homework together .
We carried a map with us in case we should lose our way .
It is quite natural for her to get angry .
He practices playing the guitar until late at night .
Tom predicted our success .
They took off after Tom .
Why would I be jealous ?
Do you have this in my size ?
It was a false alarm .
Tom will never forget all the time Mary spent with him .
Tom says he can write songs .
We re up early .
I think I ll be able to deal with that .
Did you get the package I sent you ?
He s hopelessly in love .
This is the very book I have been looking for .
It s worth a try .
You shouldn t have waited until today to do that .
Tom is still a prisoner .
I could not bring myself to eat it .
I thought you didn t know that .
Don t worry about the results .
He did not live to see the end of the war .
Tom couldn t understand why Mary laughed at him .
I m proud of you .
We ve got to get up early tomorrow . We re going on a picnic .
Cloning people raises serious ethical problems .
Parties are fun .
Cats are not human .
They sell that at a hardware store .
Tom crawled under the fence .
These are good .
Put your hands up !
Why don t you eat vegetables ?
You ve gained weight , haven t you ?
Tom said that he couldn t vouch for Mary .
Is he right ?
I shouldn t have to put up with this noise .
He goes to a school for the deaf .
Don t shut your eyes .
Tom should have listened to Mary more carefully .
He is depressed .
That is the worst thing you can do !
The fact that it s expensive doesn t mean that it s any good .
I took painkillers and kept working .
I hate her now .
Are you certain nobody followed you ?
I d like to have breakfast with you .
Tom speaks French well .
The ice has melted .
We were seated in a circle .
You re too suspicious about everything .
I ll join you later .
Tell us something .
Life is too short to worry about things like that .
It s just too soon .
Tom can t remember exactly what Mary said .
I want the same watch as my sister has .
I got out of the car at th Street .
He knows how to brush his teeth .
Who are you talking about ?
Tom was dressed in black .
Do you know Tom s phone number ?
He is afraid of becoming sick .
The man gave no heed to her loud protest .
I like languages .
That old man is a fussy eater .
This is very creepy .
My aunt treats me as if I were a child .
Keep your hands up .
Tom said he s Canadian .
Let s talk about Australia .
I m beginning to think that I shouldn t have enlisted in the army .
Tom pumped up the tire .
Many folk songs were about social problems .
Give me my beer .
Tom is also a vegetarian .
My brother caught a big fish .
I didn t know anything .
This letter is to the old woman .
His house was sold for ten thousand dollars .
Open your mouth .
Did Tom give Mary a gun ?
Can you frame this picture for me ?
Mary can sew very well .
I lived in Rome .
Just leave it there .
Try harder tomorrow .
You re my enemy .
Who ll pay the bill ?
Everyone remained calm .
I m glad to hear of your success .
I m so tired that I can t walk any longer .
Mary divorced her husband and married Tom .
Just take a number .
I told you to open the hood , not the trunk .
You re kidding me .
How do you know I m not Canadian ?
It was unfortunate that it rained yesterday .
You aren t allowed to go into that room .
This land belongs to Tom .
They never listen to me .
I have a tourist visa .
A little girl caught her fingers in the door .
There is a shop in front of my house .
I played football and my sister played tennis .
Mary likes to party .
I am aware of the fact .
Thanks for being my friend .
She stood up when her teacher came in .
Could you please tell me again who your father is ?
You lost the game .
The dressmaker took Mary s measurements .
What time do you go to the market ?
Do you see a resemblance ?
Tom can operate a forklift .
Tom is looking forward to seeing Mary again .
I wanted to show it to you .
This sounds like a trap .
Tell me where you live .
He is a dreamer .
We have only one soap dish .
I took the last cookie .
Let s do the work .
Tom didn t mean to hurt Mary .
They took the subway .
Take whichever one you like .
Swimming is good exercise for the whole body .
Tom is very sad .
Every door in the house is locked .
I d like to talk to one of your guests .
Have you taken a bath ?
Consider yourselves lucky .
I want to find out what kind of music Tom likes .
He is my uncle .
Tom cheated .
He is careless in everything .
Tom said he d be busy on Monday .
Tom asked Mary if she would teach him French .
Who do you think I am ?
Tom glared at Mary .
A good coach is like a father to his players .
We ve been searching for you for days .
We were taught that World War II broke out in .
Is French taught at your school ?
Tom is pretty sure that he can t become pregnant .
His condition is critical .
We re coming at once .
How horrible !
She pushed him off the pier .
What s there to say ?
His answer was not favorable .
I awoke from a long dream .
Tom was dying .
What language is spoken in America ?
Tom should have discussed the matter with me .
Tom was speechless .
Goodbye !
Please give me a cup of water .
Tom didn t take Mary s age into consideration .
This seat is taken .
What on earth do you want to talk to Tom about ?
I won t bother you .
That isn t convenient for me .
Tom picked up the knife and saw blood on it .
Do we need to do anything else ?
Tom doesn t like to wear a watch .
This one is for us .
Let me know your new address .
I m a good cook .
Cross the street .
I want you to make me a promise .
They re fine .
I don t want to give up .
Let s go somewhere private so we can talk .
Our principal made a long speech .
I ll tell Tom .
I want you to play the guitar for me .
Did you eat the rest of the almonds ?
I need to charge my cell phone .
I made the woman angry .
I wonder who invented it .
Wet clothes stick to your skin .
I advised him not to drive .
I have to get up early tomorrow . Can you give me a call at six ?
I m eating a pear .
I want to hire you .
I ve never seen that before .
I hate to contradict you .
I m going downtown .
He is a friendly person .
Has Tom received an invitation yet ?
You may bring whoever wants to come .
I went down by elevator .
The petals are floating on the water .
It s not as bad as it sounds .
I can t tell if Tom is joking or not .
I m not a bit tired .
That would be dangerous .
Let s not deal with that problem right now .
She couldn t convince him to buy her a new car .
She had a radio .
She hit him hard .
I m thinking of going abroad next year .
Did you enter the singing contest ?
Tom admitted that he had committed the murder .
It s a small world .
I can barely remember what my grandfather looked like .
I m a doctor .
Privacy doesn t exist .
Is that a wig ?
Five or ten minutes would not have made any difference .
You are always complaining .
I didn t know Tom had a brother .
TV s boring today .
Glad to see you , Tom .
I know someone who lives in your neighborhood .
I hope we achieve that .
He hesitated before answering .
I am a bad person .
He talks well .
The more she talked , the more bored I got .
I m not letting you escape from here .
Things happen .
He is very kind .
Give me something to drink .
He s proud of his good grades .
You can t survive without money .
That shouldn t be a problem in this case .
Who should I call ?
You re clever .
Tom wants to take a day off .
She advised him to become a teacher .
How many books did you read ?
I ll look after your child while you are away .
Mary set the basket on the table .
Have I answered your question ?
To make money one must want money .
I hate hypocrisy .
Did you know he bought a condominium ?
Tom feels much better now .
Tom can t wait .
Tom and Mary spent the weekend working on a jigsaw puzzle .
He never breaks his promise .
I believe more in diet than in drugs .
The book is easy .
I waited for hours , but she didn t show up .
Don t point your gun at anyone .
She heard him sing .
Let me see your tongue .
My father is on the wagon .
Tom has not yet been told of his father s death .
They don t know my name .
You re cuter than Mary .
They don t have a shed .
We know that Tom is here .
I never feed my dog raw meat .
Tom wanted to lose five pounds before summer vacation .
The United States is abundant in natural resources .
I m drunk , but I can still speak German .
You attach too much importance to what he says .
That s normal .
We re out of coffee .
Do you know what this means ?
Save your voice .
I haven t seen much of him recently .
I m going to live forever .
How much are oranges ?
I m losing patience .
There are few men who don t know that .
I m not sure I want to see this .
This is a valid point of view .
I have won the game .
I must go . It s getting dark .
Tom is learning to write programs in JavaScript .
I m free now .
How can you be so sure ?
We re housesitting .
Why do you think Tom would do that ?
Any bed is better than no bed .
He was deaf to my pleas .
I convinced him that he was wrong .
He lives in this lonely place by himself .
Tom helped Mary .
Tom was lucky .
His name is known all over the country .
Tom is up to his neck in debt .
Tom is a very good friend of mine .
Tom said he thought that it would be a big mistake to tell Mary what had happened .
I will pay my debt as soon as possible .
Tom concealed his anger from Mary .
It was your fault .
Don t call her now .
This sounds like French .
The boy grew taller and taller , till at last he exceeded his father in height .
Tom was never happy .
Tom thought it was a good idea to take advantage of the opportunity that Mary had given him .
Many Asians are lactose intolerant .
I still have a job to do .
I admit that I was wrong .
Tom could ve been killed .
I m going off to Vancouver next week to see my sister .
I gave my brother a dictionary .
My brother helped me with my homework .
That student s studying sociology .
She participated in the beauty contest .
Don t ask for money .
Let s talk about the problem .
You have to be honest .
Just because Tom said he had never met Mary doesn t mean it s true .
I probably would ve done the same thing .
Where shall I wait for you ?
Does your wife work ?
Tom and I go to the same high school .
It was Tom who first suggested that this might be the cause .
Why would your opinion be more important than mine ?
May I ask how old you are ?
Tom is someone who can t be trusted .
Do you want to rest ?
He works at the bank .
His story sounds strange .
I m listening to Bj rk s latest song .
She bought a dozen eggs .
Finish this .
I d like to sit by the window .
Papa made sure all the lights were turned off before going to bed .
I couldn t find his house .
You remind me of a boy I used to know .
There are a lot of things I have to do .
She was standing in the middle of the room .
That was a great call .
They meant well .
You look happier than usual .
The policeman was drunk .
They were put in prison .
All sorts of people came to the exhibition .
A string on my guitar broke .
Tom can t always get what he wants .
Tom is leaving in three days .
You must be able to speak either English or Spanish in this company .
I think about that from time to time .
I am an English teacher .
Tom saw the pictures .
The decision was easy .
Did Tom hit Mary ?
I need to know what I should tell Tom .
My dad bought me books .
This box is not as big as that one .
Where is Customs ?
He did poorly in his studies .
Don t you know that you are the laughingstock of the whole town ?
He is said to be a genius .
They embraced .
Having good oral hygiene is important .
Tom wonders if it s true .
We didn t see this movie .
I ll wait a day or two .
I m incredibly busy .
He soon left the new job .
Tom set a trap .
I took my shoes off .
My sister often takes care of the baby .
Do I have to pay you ?
It s yours if you want it .
What does your job entail ?
He worked far into the night .
The only thing that matters is that you are alive .
I have to be at the station at three o clock .
I just need a couple of aspirin .
She helped him tie his tie because he didn t know how to .
Great men are not always wise .
Tom wanted to meet you .
As for me , I am not satisfied with the result of the examination the other day .
I jog in the morning .
What did Tom do here ?
Where do you think you re going ?
It s the only thing Tom can do .
Please forgive me for telling a lie .
Where is the nearest telephone ?
We re not in the s anymore .
I m spending Christmas Eve with my family .
What was your favorite book when you were a child ?
He paid with a credit card .
This is an order .
The boy remained silent .
I can t remember how to say Thank you in German .
Karl Valentin was a philosopher .
I am reading the book .
I was called on in English class .
Did you want to show me something ?
I lost my house keys .
Please take another one .
Your questions were too direct .
What do you do in your free time ?
Tom said it was none of my business .
Tom is rested .
We sat in the center of the room .
Are these yours ?
Tom hasn t cleaned his gun in a long time .
Tom s car was stuck in the mud .
Mary doesn t use salt in her cooking .
He asked Lincoln to say a few words .

Should I clean my room ?
Tom speaks better French than Mary .
They re cleaning the beach .
Tom gained the respect and loyalty of his employees .
Tom didn t die in vain .
This is a Japanese doll .
Nothing is free .
Tom is brushing his teeth .
Don t make me ask you again .
The village in which he was born is far from here .
How can Tom be so stupid ?
I have lost my camera .
That s my affair .
Was it a hard decision ?
I don t think I ve made enough spaghetti for everyone .
Envious people die , but envy never does .
I go to the movies every week .
There is nothing for you to be angry about .
That s weird .
Why is that good ?
Do you know whether she can speak English ?
I had Tom do it instead .
Tom is different from other boys .
Would you like me to teach you how to play chess ?
I caught a cold and was in bed yesterday .
Mathematics is her weak point .
I want to plant a vegetable garden .
He plays very well .
Don t let your feelings show .
Where is your room ?
It s deer season .
I can t write in Chinese .
I finally gave up smoking .

You ll need that .
I m very short of money .
She teaches English .
I don t like people like Tom .
Do what he tells you .
Don t lie . Be honest .
I need to keep my eyes open .
This is going to be easy .
He s not an idiot .
Tom got on the train .
Tom has something to hide .
Do you want to play soccer with us ?
Many people do this .
He raised his hand and smiled .
I don t feel like laughing .
I ve never met someone that I love as much as I love you .
Look at us .
Your new hair style makes you look older .
You don t even know what it is .
Tom is stupider than you think .
We re here to help you .
Tom and I want you to come with us .
Didn t I lend you some money yesterday ?
Tom explained the system to Mary .
You re a very good guitarist .
He is still angry .
Tom doesn t know which button to push .
Why are you so tired ?
I saw him twice today .
Even though Tom had promised to pay , he stuck Mary with the bill .
To a man with a hammer , everything looks like a nail .
I went on reading .
I won t tolerate it anymore .
Tom started to get a little angry .
I m going to kiss you .
Many people do not trust the government .
Who has a better idea ?
Let s play hide and seek .
I want to show you something else .
To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure ?
Can you explain it to me ?
I ll be free this evening .
The three boys opened the doors of the building .
Tom is a very sensible person .
When I was taking a bath , the telephone rang .

I m an optimist .
I ran out of the house .
What is your name , sir ?
Tom didn t say anything at all .
Tom wanted to ask Mary a question .
I know .
I have been to Kyoto twice .
Tom might have stolen Mary s camera .
I study about two hours every day .
That s what Tom gets paid for .
You always sing .
Tom made spaghetti for dinner .
Are you content with your present salary ?
Just say yes .
Tom put his gun under his pillow .
We have to keep working .
Large amounts of money were spent on the new bridge .
Speak more slowly , please !
Tom returned the keys to Mary .
They crashed .
She s been in the hospital for a month .
I wish I had a reason not to stay .
I spent the whole day in the park .
Can you solve the puzzle ?
It was not until yesterday that I noticed it .
I can t afford the time to travel .
As far as I know , this is the latest edition .
Would you give me something cold to drink ?

They re making too much noise . I can t concentrate .
You re not supposed to eat on the job .
We believe that it was Tom that killed Mary .
My friends congratulated me on my success .
Tom will probably tell Mary not to look out the window .
Mary s wedding ring is made of pure gold .
I ve been waiting here for him since this morning .
Tom can t say for sure when Mary will arrive .
There s nothing there .
I am a student in a university .
The money was all there . Nobody touched it .
The ladder was covered with dust and rust .
Please come on Monday .

You ve gained weight .
From his accent , I would guess that man is Scottish .
You can watch television .
Please turn on the TV .
You ll understand someday .

You re very pretty .
It s only a game .

They never came .
Tom admired Mary .
We humans have a great way of twisting facts to fit our conclusion as soon as we have made one .
Let s do some exercise to work up an appetite .
Have you any references from your other employers ?
It failed .
Forget Tom .
I think you ll want to contact Tom as soon as possible .
Nobody cares for me .
We seldom have snow here .
I am sure of his passing the examination .
If it is sunny tomorrow , we will go on a picnic .
They competed with each other for the prize .
Don t forget that it s Tom s birthday tomorrow .
What s your favorite class ?
I can t remember what his name is .
Tom doesn t understand the value of money .
Why are you so quiet ?
She listened to him .
I wish I were younger .
He offered his seat to an old woman .
He is the baby of the family .
Tom just got fired .
Won t you come to my house next Sunday ?
The capital of France is Paris .
Would you give me the recipe for your salad ?
You must be more patient .
We are in the era of atomic energy .
There may be another way to do this .
I ll wait .
My grandfather loves to read .
She s our teacher .
I wonder if I ll ever see you again .
I will wait till you have written the letter .

Tom would help us if he could .
Don t worry . It ll be over soon .
They often clashed over their political beliefs .
He s your friend .
Today s low was degrees Celsius .
Yesterday my uncle bought a dog .
I don t remember her name anymore .
Do you live in Portugal or Brazil ?
I think I ve broken my arm .
I decided I wouldn t do that .
I told Tom he should go .
Make another choice .
Her mother went to the United States to learn English .
How did you solve the problem ?
The heat of the sun hardens clay .
What s going to happen to me now ?
When I think about those students , it gives me a headache .
What part of my explanation didn t you understand ?
Seven is believed to be a lucky number .
Don t be afraid to ask questions .
I need to go to Boston .
He hit the mark .
I wonder what I should get you for your birthday .
Tom dove into the water and swam as fast as he could .
May I start eating now ?
I know this .
Did you say yes ?
I tried not to look into her eyes .
Both my sisters are teachers .
Tell them that there was someone here looking for them .
It rained heavily yesterday .
He s got terrible handwriting .
Do you live here ?
Perhaps she will come tomorrow .
Why would you want to hurt Tom ?
The boy tried moving the heavy sofa .
I know what I m giving you for Christmas .
Tom often feels drowsy after eating lunch .
I know you d never let anyone hurt Tom .
No one I know talks to Tom anymore .
Tom broke one of the rules and was kicked out of school .
We have supplied those families with food .
Why are you sweating ?
Where does this flag come from ?
I m feeling kind of tired .
I like this one even better .
Tom was in town Monday night .
Mary went to dancing school .
Now it s serious .
The price of the car is too high .

I assure you Tom will be perfectly safe .
We must fix this .
He is wearing glasses .
Have you found your contact lenses ?
I should tell Tom everything .
I want to go to America .
They faced the danger bravely .
Tom loves to tell stories .
I don t have time to write .
Her name is Mary .
She s unfit for the job .
He brought his dog to school .
Tom didn t mean to cause Mary any trouble .
More and more people are falling behind in their mortgage payments .
We heard gunfire .
Tom is one of Mary s best friends .
Do not walk outside this area .
Tom is OK now .
Could you please not smoke in this room ?
I need someone to talk to .
Are you planning to help them ?
She is curious to find who sent the flowers .
I no longer want to live in Boston .
To be happy , you should spend time with someone you love .
Could you give me the salt ?
Everybody knows that he is still alive .
I couldn t have said it any better myself .
The sun was shining and it was warm , so I took the day off .
Sit at the table .
I plugged in the TV .
What lovely eyes she has !
We must be alert to dangers .
I can t stand this noise .
Tom always keeps his word .
Tom said he didn t know the answer .
Mary wishes she had straight hair .
I have blonde hair .
I want to be able to speak English .
Can you swim ?
I am very pleased .
They re about to start .
They hated Tom .
Don t speak .
You should get your car fixed .
Why don t you try one of these ?
Arthritis is a painful condition that affects the joints .
Some of them are my friends .
They already know .
The station is about three miles from here .
Come here by ten at the latest .
In those days , few people could travel abroad .

She has nice legs .

The dog looks hungry .
I talk in my sleep .
I m good at skiing .
Tom is madly in love with Mary .
Excuse me , but may I ask you something .
Tom fell down .
I don t want to see you here again .
A good newspaper reporter takes advantage of what he learns from any source , even the little bird told him so type of source .
Please make my bed .
I am injured .
Excuse me , but will you tell me the way to the station ?
Tom blushed when he saw Mary naked .
I heard that Tom is going to get married soon .
He has helped the poor throughout his life .
Tom joined us .
Deeds are better than words .
I ve just come back from a long trip .
The cat is brown .
Tom wished that his classmates would treat each other with more respect .
There s a guy in there with a gun . I need backup .
Give it to me now .
Tom kissed Mary on the neck .
They wanted to earn money .
It s easier to teach children than to teach adults .
She ate her dinner .
Please come here .
Abandon ship !
The cat hid among the branches .
Must this letter be written in English ?
I wonder why tennis is played in mini skirts .
I went to Tom s house the night before he died .
Is there something that you want ?
Tom was electrocuted .
I ve lost my car key .
Write your name in capital letters .
The universe is endless .
Please put a pitcher of water in my room .
Stay right there .
That new song is called Lollipop .
Tom heard Mary play the piano .
She was astonishingly beautiful .
Tom hasn t seen Mary since .
Can you buy one for me as well ?
Adopting the new policy was the best thing this company ever did .
There are no rules .
Help me .
I think that someone went there .
He is a boy with many dreams .
Will you come tomorrow ?
I might be able to get you a discount .
I know where to hide .
Tom is still baffled .
Tom is a young and talented dancer .
Tom cared .
I m out of breath .
Oh , by the way , I have something to tell you .
Her wishes , it seems , have come true .
Suddenly , a man stepped in front of them .
Don t say such a thing again .
This yogurt tastes strange .
I don t know where this belongs .
Would you mind my staying here for some time ?
Tom isn t able to drive yet .
I wish he were here .
You re babbling .
Let s go see how Tom is doing .
He disguised himself as a woman .
That goes against my beliefs .
French is a difficult language .
I m very impressed by your work .
I want to hear what Tom says .
Tom won t take no for an answer .
The bomb exploded with a blinding flash .
The projector doesn t work .
I ache all over .
Anything that is too stupid to be spoken is sung .
You re completely healthy .
He would do whatever it takes to make money .
Tom is in charge of the barbecue .
When will your book be published ?
Tom can t move as quickly as Mary can .
I would go to the movies if I had the time .
I know all their names .
There were no more free seats .
He s your typical workaholic .
He knew the news , but he kept it to himself .
Do you eat meat ?
How deep ?
I held onto the rope for as long as I could , but I finally had to let go .
Do you want me to leave ?
You may ask me any question you want .
Have you cleaned your room yet ?
Canada is larger than Japan .

Tom told Mary not to add sugar .
She told me she would be here about six .
The two laughed .
Tom has no conception of what it s like to be in love .
Where is the toilet ?
I bought the same shirt as yours .
What was Tom looking for ?
You can t park here .
We did everything we could to save the boy .
Mental exercise is particularly important for young children .
I m going to Berlin to visit my friend .
Can you stay for a few days ?
She pretended that she knew nothing about it .
Tom committed suicide when he was thirty .
They died one after another .
This shirt costs more than fifty dollars .
It seemed that he had been ill .
That boy speaks as if he were an adult .
She is just a child .
She writes music for a living .
I think Tom might be telling the truth .
She is proud of her children .
I wanted her to come here this evening .
Nobody saw anything .
My cat rubbed her head against my shoulder .
She could read when she was four .
Tom deserves a reward .
I ll do as you advise .
She is angry with me .

I don t share your optimism .
I can eat anything .
Monday was so hectic .
I am afraid he will make a mistake .
Did you remember to buy candles ?
They cheered .
Tom asked Mary what her plans for the future were .
We re not perfect .
The world is full of fools .
The poor cat was run over by a truck .
This is my sister .
I can t remember ever doing that .
He is sure that he will succeed .
I want to know your opinion .
The joke is on Tom .
Was I wrong ?
I don t understand your question .
I have to be back home by seven .

It hasn t been done before .
She used to love him .

You must respect your elders .
We wish you well , Tom .
They work hard .
His way of thinking is very childish .
He is not from Hokkaido .
I think he s competent .
What s your favorite place to go when you want to think ?
Smoking is banned in restaurants in California .
Bring the key .
Do you think he will come ? I hope not .
They enjoy one another s company .
Would you like to leave a message for him ?
We couldn t figure it out .
I was not pleased by your rude behavior .
I can t see anything from here .
Do you love each other that much ?
I live in a house that was built in .
I m doing fairly well now .
Take anything you want .

Give me another example .
I can t tell them apart .

I forgot my key .
Are you busy today ?
No one questioned anything .
When did you ask Tom ?
I feel bad for him .
It s all over now .
I no longer wish to be a part of this project .
This tastes good .
I only slept two hours .

I have never seen them anywhere .
We all die in the end .

He attained his goal .
Can you answer this riddle ?

Did Tom give you something ?
Many of my friends think that Tom and Mary are overprotective parents .
There was a great deal of conjecture as to what would happen .
They re in .
Everybody knows that .
I polished up the floor and furniture .
Follow your dreams .
She kept quiet .
What time is it , anyway ?

I am surprised to see you here in this hotel .

You won t find a dog bigger than this one .
How do you do it ?
I didn t sell Tom my car .
I have to wake Tom up .
Why didn t you go to school today ?
It looks good .
I m sorry , but it s impossible .
I gave Tom Monday off .
Give me a ring if you find out anything .
I ll wait another five minutes .
The teacher is sitting on the chair .
Tom cut the article out of the newspaper .
I want to change jobs .

I m not sure I know what to do .
Can I drive , please ?
You can t hit Tom and expect him not to hit you back .
We made pancakes for breakfast .
They didn t seem to notice it .
Every child misbehaves from time to time .
I beg your pardon . I didn t think this was your seat .
Would you like to know how to prevent getting wrinkles ?
The accident wasn t your fault .

No one is to leave .
Do you like music ?
They aren t afraid of death .
I ve never told anyone .
I feel that I don t really belong here .
They never showed up .
I have no idea who Tom s wife is .
They were all friends as children .

Are there earthquakes in Germany ?

Tom doesn t trust strangers .
Do you have enough money ?
There s a secret drawer in the desk .
Did you understand what he said ?
He comes here once a month .
I drank too much and the ground seemed to spin under my feet .
I m feeling claustrophobic .
He arrived on time in spite of the rain .
You should have enough sense not to drink , at least during your illness .
What happened to my furniture ?
This coffee is really strong .
He has a car that has four doors .
I work with him .
Are you the only one who has a key to this door ?
He has a lot of money in the bank .
Have you heard from him recently ?

The sample is not pure enough .
I would like to know her name .
Did you lock the door ?
What a beautiful sunset !

Would you like more mashed potatoes ?
Tom certainly has a nice voice .
He was deaf to my pleas .
It is true that the earth is round .
Don t lie anymore , OK ?

Why should anyone pay ?
Tom floated down the river on a raft .
How did Tom find us ?

Tom lit his cigar .
Tom hasn t yet heard anything definite about whether he got into Harvard or not .
How s the dog ?
Who built this place ?
His brother is more patient than he is .

None of these games are interesting .
I don t intend to ever talk to Tom again .
Please take care of yourself .
Did you sign ?
There is always something happening here .

You should carry out your duty .
We re one big , happy family .
We went on a picnic together .
What are you thinking about ?
I like my chicken wings with barbeque sauce .

How much time do you spend selecting the food that you will eat ?
It s an extreme case .

There s nothing in the fridge .
I have some questions for you .
I don t feel like laughing .
That girl looks like Mary .
How did you and Tom meet ?
Are you going to buy that car ?
She is at the top of her class .

Tom has nothing better to do right now .
I ll give you a present .
Let s start !
Do you mind if I join you ?
Are the drinks free ? Only for ladies .
Tom told me he was having trouble sleeping .
Unfortunately , the hotel that you suggested was completely booked up .

It s essential that you understand the situation .

Do you have a hobby , Tom ?
Tom made up his mind to be a helicopter pilot .
He earned her love .
Buildings are much stronger now than they used to be .

Even today , his theory remains practically irrefutable .
Thanks for bringing Tom home .

Tom spent most days begging for money in front of tourist attractions .
Why don t you cry ?
When was the last time you lost your keys ?

When I arrived at the station , the train had already left .
If everyone agrees to it , I won t vote against it .
You can t keep talking to me like this .
Even though Tom tried to explain it to Mary , she still couldn t understand .
It happened a long time ago .
It is rude to point at others .
She gave a faint smile .

Tom leaned back in his chair .
You can t see the forest for the trees .
Is that supposed to happen ?
We like playing soccer .
I can t give up my dream .
You were happy .
We felt sympathy for her .
Maybe what you said is true .
Tom says he can t ignore the smell any longer .
We have a stock of toilet paper .
I have a lot of ideas .
This bag is made of leather .
He gathered the courage to decline the offer .
I hope that you will continue to favor us with your support .
I overslept and consequently couldn t join them .
You seem pretty nice .
I hate milk .
My mother cooks well .
We are afraid .
How often does it rain in Boston ?
You can go now , sir .
He is anxious to know the result .
We have a theory .
It s a nice day , isn t it ? Why not go out for a walk ?
She is not afraid of anything .
He tore the photographs into pieces .
I guess I ve gotten lazy .
She plays the guitar .
A mouse is running around the room .
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago .
I was dizzy .
Who are my new neighbors ?
I can t show you .
He hinted at his intention .
I want Tom to clean the kitchen .
Mt . Everest is the highest mountain in the world .
Japan guaranteed a billion yen aid package to developing countries .
When can we eat ?
I bought a dozen spoons and two dozen forks .
You have many friends .
Tom really had a good time .
I ll need to check my schedule .
It s your choice .
I joined the study tour .
Tom didn t know the reason why Mary was crying .
We should ve stayed at home .
Tom decided not to attend the meeting .
I was born on October th , .
You won t die .
I m proud to be Canadian .
The more I think about it , the less I like it .
They were playing a game of checkers .
I m seeing ghosts .
I m very short of money .
I don t want to go by plane , if I can help it .
Obey your teachers .
They were sick .
You are very beautiful .
Tom jogs three times a week .
Do you really care what I think ?
Where will you be staying ?
You didn t have to wake me up .
That s the key .
Why do you want that anyway ?
He knows neither how to read nor write .
They re in the science lab .
Well , what happened to her ?
Don t talk to Tom .
The train was delayed on account of a heavy snow .
I m freezing .
I had no choice but to accept the offer .
Everything is ready .
Can you imagine what our lives would be like without electricity ?
This room is quiet .
Let me give you my business card .
He always yells at me when he is angry .
When did you open your new store ?
She cried bitterly .
I didn t realize that you were feeling so bad .
Air is a mixture of several gases .
Make way , dude . I m coming through .
He confessed that he had fallen in love with me .
Tom should ve danced with Mary .
He smokes twenty cigarettes a day .
You may go home now .
You can make your own .
It looks like Mary is drunk again .
I just don t know how I will be able to meet all my deadlines !
I want to remind you that you have a appointment .
I wish you a happy birthday .
We would die without air .
You are working too hard . Take it easy for a while .
She glanced shyly at the young man .
I can t really do anything .
It s nine thirty .
Unfortunately , my father isn t at home .
Classes will resume Monday .
My parents live in the country .
I ve got a cold .
Take the money and run .
Didn t I show you my new Mustang ?
Any time you want to borrow my car , all you have to do is ask .
Tom lied to Mary when he said he didn t know John .
We seem to have escaped from danger .
Who s the second in command ?
She s older than him .
It s self explanatory .
Even though her vet told her not to , she continued to feed her dog raw vegetables .
I understand that it s not fair .
They re in the shower .
You aren t afraid of ghosts , are you ?
The story takes place in Lisbon .
I succeeded in my first attempt .
Tom has another plan .
Are you happy with your weight ?
He smiled at us and got on the train .
Tom has no idea what to do .
I ate at three restaurants last week . I liked all three of them .
Neither of my brothers will be there .
We go to school because we want to learn .
I ve suddenly started to gain weight .
The weather was getting worse and worse as the day went on .
You have my permission to leave .
It s your fault .
I know it s against the law .
They despise you .
Please don t leave me alone .
Just leave us alone .
One of my friends says he wants me to meet you .
If I had eaten breakfast this morning , I would not be hungry now .
Tom took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes .
I knew we were in trouble then .
Tom said he saw Mary at the movie theater with John .
Besides being a surgeon , he was a famous writer .
Tell me where to put this .
It hardly ever rains there .
Wait for the police .
I m racking my brains to find a solution .
I know you re angry .
I d like to get to know you better .
His failure was due to his idleness .
You have so much potential .
I read the New York Times .
I m going to have to pass on that .
We consider it the citizens legitimate right to have public libraries .
Are you bringing your camera ?
Come on , get up .
He spent the evening reading a book .
I wonder if I ll ever get married .
My jaw is sore .
We came back by way of Boston .
Whenever I meet her , she smiles at me .
We want you to marry Tom .
You know everything .
What do you want me to say ?
How much money did you spend last week ?
I think it ll take more than a year to finish building our house .
I know it very well .
There are various reasons why a house may be left vacant .
Tom said he had been asked a lot of questions .
I never should ve kissed Tom s girlfriend .
Ten years is a long time .
Tom decided to study law .
Tom is proud of his daughter .
It s not far from here .

Should we change the flag ?
They adopted the little girl .
I wanted a jacket .
Are you flexible ?

She is good at speaking English .
I informed her of my arrival .
My uncle made a will last year .
Tom doesn t know his own strength .
Tom deposited some money in his savings account just yesterday .
There s a rock on the floor .
Since he says so , it must be true .
I had to get up early .

In my opinion , said the younger brother , you are wrong .
We could hear wolves howling in the distance .
Tom is a freelance writer .
Tom is inspired .
She spends a lot of time practicing the piano .
I arrived too late and missed the train .
We don t need anyone else .
Don t make noise .
May I have a moment of your time ?
Leave us alone for a minute .
This road leads to the station .
Who are those women ?
Where do you come from ?
What time will you get to Tokyo ?
My new Alfa Romeo convertible is light red .
I can t hear you very well .
I hope the economy picks up soon .
While we re waiting , why don t you tell me what happened ?
Tom hasn t told us his opinion yet .
The sun is shining brightly .
She put salt into her coffee by mistake .
He said , Let s take a short rest .
That book is available in only one store .
We want our money .
Tom said , budge over , forced his way in and sat down .
I am very sorry for what I said .
I want to be more than friends .
Have the police been called ?
I like the way you look .
There was a crowd of students waiting in front of the library .
There were too many people at the concert .
It s up to me .
Tom is a university student .
Someone s in the next room .

I don t want to leave Tom alone .

You can t fight a good fight with such a defeatist attitude .
This is the calm before the storm .
Tom didn t do that right .
She understands music .
My father told me where to go .
There were over fifteen thousand spectators .
You ll have to ask someone else .
I can t even do that .
What did you learn at school today ?
I am taking a rest in my car .
What s your favorite climate ?
I ll be discreet .

I ll ask Tom the next time I see him .
She s teaching us French .
If we re going to do this , let s do it right .
It made me laugh out loud .
The cat is sleeping on the chair .
How do you feel ?
Our fate depends on your decisions .
When I woke up , it was snowing .
They should all be fired .
Tom said that he was thirsty .
I know the gentleman .
The man died a few hours ago .
Minnesota s state bird is the mosquito .
You can find the same thing anywhere .
Where have you been ?
I m always busy with my homework .

Don t take me seriously . I m only joking .
Don t touch it . Leave it as it is .
Bring help .
Please turn on the radio .
This is very wrong .
I thanked him for helping me .
Mary looks absolutely stunning .
She lives in Yokohama .
Nothing had moved .
Let me give you several other reasons why you should do that .
Tom picked up that habit from his father .
Take care of your own affairs yourself .
Are you drinking ?
One of the people you were with is a friend of mine .
It s hard to believe .
This is my favorite project .
Does your brother know how to drive ?

He ran through the streets naked .

We ve got them .
We should have been more careful .

I don t want to go to Boston with you .
What is the population of Japan ?
I ll be back in a minute .
You re going to be jealous .
I forgot the key to my room .
I punched him in the chin .
You look like a baboon .
It s not even on the map .
I assume you re angry .
You look very charming today .
Tom will be thrilled .
The computer is a recent invention .
Who made those policies ?
Nobody has seen the bird fly .
I ve been very busy lately .
What kind of question is that ? Do you really expect me to answer that ?
I m not at all tired .
There is a man at the door .
Tom doesn t want to give up .
This book deals with life in the United Kingdom .
I am glad to see her .
Tom made me a cup of hot chocolate .
Don t go near the fire .
We should remain quiet .
Why is God punishing me ?
I felt like I was dead .
What s today s menu ?
You were right .
The man finally confessed .
A rat ran across the road .
I ve saved the best for last .
I just need some information .
A parrot can imitate human speech .
Did you actually see Tom ?
Is Tom home ?
It will not be long before she comes back .
I thought Tom would never leave .
I don t like the way she speaks .
They all left .
Tom looks a bit tired .
You d better start now .
Only out of the passengers survived .
We have to be at work by nine .
Please keep this a secret .
It s been a long time since I visited my grandmother .
I had a very high fever .
Do you think Tom can do that ?
It s the perfect size .
Tom hid the gun in the cookie jar on top of the refrigerator .
He was too shy to do that .
I have heard nothing from him for five years .
His sorrow was written all over his face .
We go to school to learn .
Don t be too hard on me .
I saw a mouse !
If I were a bird , I could fly to you .
We have many friends to visit in Tokyo .
Tom always drinks at least three cups of coffee in the morning .
He always wears blue shirts .
I like tennis and golf .
Who is that person ?
You re an unreliable witness .
I found your wallet on the backseat of my car .
I ll ask later .
Tom left a large tip on the table .
The cage is open .
This film is worth seeing .
At last he reached his goal .
We re going .
I do not have any money .
I swam in the river .
You should get to school .
I can t draw , but my sister is a great artist .
She was almost hit by a car .
I know how to solve the problem , but I ve been asked not to tell you .
I like watching TV .
Please help me pick out a sweater which matches my new dress .
I was waiting for you .
I had a feeling that Tom was in trouble .
I have a surprise for you .
Don t just stand there . Do something .
The women of France are beautiful .
It is extremely hot and humid in Bali in December .
Who stood ?
Tom sighed .
I don t know what motivated me to come here .
Are you insane ?
Tom didn t even have enough money to buy a cup of coffee .
She married him only because her parents made her .
We re twins .
Pain , pain , go away .
He locked himself in the bathroom .
Tom didn t understand anything .
Tom bought a beer for himself .
Tom wanted to buy a new pair of boots .
It s difficult to get out of bed on cold mornings .
She found me a good seat .
He s leaving for China tomorrow .
Tom is the one who told me who to give it to .
Don t play dumb !
I met her three days ago .
Excuse me . Can you speak English ?
Tom didn t like not having enough money .
There comes the bus .
They said yes .
You ve got to like Tom .
I love reading books .
The yen is rising and the dollar is falling .

Keep quiet !
I could have stayed a while longer , but I was getting tired , so I decided to leave .
Tom took a bath last night .
This is my big moment .
That s what Tom told me .
Tom gladly accepted .
There is no fire without smoke .
I know you are clever .
I don t like pizza anymore .
Has prison changed her ?
You can do it .
I like to be surprised .
Every mistake made me stronger .
You re contagious .
Hold on a sec .
Why did Tom quit his job ?
It s not his style .
I hope it won t be long before I hear from her .
Do you like Celtic music ?
We saw a dim light in the distance .
She may not be aware of the danger .
All of a sudden , the door shut with a bang .
What s your favorite commercial ?
Tom and his classmates are going to an art museum tomorrow afternoon .
I d just like to have a quick conversation with Tom before we leave .
I can t believe you weren t as impressed as I was .
I definitely think so .
The meeting was almost over .
It was really close .
Tom removed his wet socks .
Thanks for picking me up .
He is nothing but a minor composer .
The problem is that we have no money .
What did Tom talk about ?
Why did you allow it to happen ?
The curtain fell .
You can t help now . It s too late .
Tom isn t capable of doing it .
This machine can print sixty pages a minute .
I can t see you without thinking of your mother .
Where on earth are we ?
I d like to be your boyfriend .
Her face suddenly turned red .
Everyone thinks so .
He and I are such close friends that we can almost read each other s minds .
Tom thinks that s ridiculous .
Think about pay day .
There used to be a church here .
Tom is very afraid of snakes .
Spanish is spoken in Mexico .
Tom hid his worries from his wife .
Turn on the gas .
Many shoes nowadays are made of plastics .
I m just beginning .
Your skirt is out of fashion .
He got the job by a fluke .
If he has time , he will come .
We re on our way home .
What time is it there ?
What does Tom want from us ?
I think he will succeed .
Nature is full of mystery .
Tom found what he was looking for on the top shelf .
I m sorry if my words hurt you .
He is always giving presents to his wife .
I know I m in the way .
The grass needs cutting .
I went to the park last Sunday .
The program does not allow for changes at this point in time .
I was overconfident .
There is a message for you .
I heard a beautiful song yesterday .
All the students study English .

They can change .

Pull up to the curb .
Don t deceive him .
He s a big coward .
Tom went straight to the post office .
Why is my Internet connection so slow ?
I worked a lot today .
He tidied up his room .
The only one who has a problem with this is you .

He is a good writer .
There is nothing more refreshing than a cold beer on a hot day .
You look happy .
I can t go with you .
This lake is the deepest in Japan .

He stuck with his own theory .
I could never make him believe what I said .
I waited for a reply .
She was crying in her room .
Where do you think Tom went ?
They have English lessons three times a week .
He eats nothing else but fruit .
It is high time I was going .
He was forced to return to Washington .
She said that she takes a shower every morning .
I am going to play tennis .
Is anyone hurt ?
Concentrate , Tom .
Get out of the kitchen !
Tom appeared to be in his early thirties .
My best friend dances really well .
Although he is very old , he is strong .
She repeated what she had heard to her mother .
Tom could hardly understand what Mary said .
I missed you very much yesterday .
I m kind of sleepy , too .
They re idiots .
I ll keep it in mind .
He has the habit of scratching his head .
They ll understand .

He seemed surprised at the news .
Can t we fire Tom ?
Tom hasn t yet done what we ve asked him to do .
You know what you have to do .
I wrote that book .
Does the amount of rain affect the growth of crops ?
I want to look like her .
Tom is in a foul mood today .

Those shoes go well with this white skirt .
Everyone loves puppets .

Tom came in carrying something .
These are daises .
No one knows if he loves her or not .

You don t even know who they are .

He fell asleep under the tree .
Everybody was interested in the story .

She didn t buy anything from the store .
Everyone is staring at Tom .
Show me the photos you took in Paris .
You re a terrible liar .
Tom isn t thrilled .
I would have failed without his help .

I only have one brother .
Do you enjoy studying ?
Stay here with us .

If you want to speak to me , please call me up .
I have a train to catch .
I can t tell you what happened .
I only need a minute .

French is his mother tongue .
I m new at this .
Can you at least pretend you want to be here ?
Speak softly .
My uncle gave me his car .
The phone was ringing , but there was no one to answer it .
I m restless .
This is how we ve got to know each other .
There s still some beer in the fridge .
Tom got back together with Mary .
The fire went out by itself .
She goes to night school .
Some boys play tennis and others play soccer .
I haven t bought any furniture yet .
These shoes are very comfortable .
Are you sure ?
Could you tell what he said ?
It made me feel bad .
Tom asked Mary to take off her shoes before she entered his house .
Her novel was translated into Japanese .
Butter is made from milk .

He arrived at the station out of breath .
They began to climb the hill .
They arrived separately .

Is Tom drunk ?
Did he do such things ?
I had too much to drink last night .
Tom was in trouble financially .
He has nothing to do with the matter .
The British climbed the hill .

We just want to be together .

Why did Tom leave ?
He doesn t tan .
We don t like this house .
I think now is the time .
I was about to go .
We climbed right up to the top .
Tom spread some strawberry jam on a slice of bread .
He had lost all hope .
She s stark naked .
I like that dress better than this one .
Did he look like a doctor ?

It seems to me that we should go now .
The dish is too sweet for Tom .
Where s the closest bus stop ?
I m in a bad mood today .
How tall is your brother ?

I sensed immediately that something was wrong .
This place has a mysterious atmosphere .
Out of twenty students , only one has read the book .
It s raining again .
The last thing I want to do is come between you and Tom .

He has very bad handwriting .
She explained to him why she couldn t visit him .
I object to being treated like that .
Would you like to dance with me ?
Where are your keys ?
Did he learn Japanese as well ?
Of course , many senior citizens are happy with retirement .
I pretended to work .
Generally , the Japanese are very diligent workers .
I took the cake out of the oven .
I have no idea what I m up against .

She has too many boyfriends .
No one wants to talk about books anymore .
You can t imagine it , can you ?
I thought Tom would surprise Mary and take her to dinner .
You can tell us .
The drug must go through clinical trials before being approved .
She sat next to him on the bus .
So what s your problem ?
Whatever will be , will be .
Tom trusted Mary .
Give me another cup of tea .
What did you hear ?
I hope you aren t alone .
I hope that she ll get well soon .
He fed his dog at the same time every day .
If you keep on drinking like that , you ll get sick .
She has a book .
Her speech was full of wit .
He seems not to have realized its importance .
I finished work at six .
I m going to help Tom .

June is the month when we have a lot of rain .
There isn t time to explain in detail .

Let s do this before I change my mind .
I ll wait .
So long .
You may not smoke in the elevator .
My plane leaves at six o clock .
I had never seen a panda until I went to China .

Can I stay ?
Do you believe in God ?
Will it bother you if I turn on the radio ?
Come on in !
I d better get started .
Lots of my friends are going there tonight .
If you change your address , please let me know .
That street is very noisy .
You needn t do it at once .
Tom looked unkempt after not shaving for three days .
Was he in Hokkaido last year ?
Maybe you should stop reading romance novels .
Every time I see him , he is smiling .
I believe in friendship .
My friends are amazing .
He couldn t maintain his authority .
I do like fish .
Bell invented the telephone .
Which is your favorite team ?
I ll assist you .

Illness prevented me from going to school .
From this point , we ll go on by car .

He advised us against doing it .
I was almost killed .
He is a pioneer in this field .
He rescued the dog at the risk of his own life .
The train is coming .
Do you feel lucky ?

Put it over there .

As soon as he felt his house shake , he rushed out into the garden .
I only want what s best for everyone .
We clean our classroom after school .
Tom sometimes sings in French .
This letter is personal , and I don t want anyone else to read it .

Please go and see who it is .
Tom pushed one of the buttons .
Don t stop here .
Leave us .
Tom doesn t understand how a computer works .

What time do you get up in the morning ?
Some people don t think so .
Did you speak to anybody ?
You re innocent .
It s not quite ready yet .
Tom made it plain that he wanted Mary to do the work by herself .
My first impression of him proved to be correct .
I can t do it without a hammer .
Does everyone need to know this ?

Who listened ?
Did you hear the news ?
We have nothing to lose .
It is clear what must be done .
That boy talks as if he were a grown up .

I threw a ball to my dog and he caught it in his mouth .
Breakfast is served .
I d like to be left alone for a while , if you don t mind .

They must be Americans .
It s very difficult to carry out that project .
The summer is over .
Actually , it s very easy to learn .
He wants red glasses .
I m happy Tom liked it .

He was home alone at the time .
Thousands of satellites orbit around the earth .
No decent people go to that place .

They re average students .
Are you feeling better , Tom ?
She hit him again and again .
We have a lot to talk about .
Read the story aloud .
Thanks for everything , Tom .
She has a ring whose value is beyond belief .
Tom looks like a tired old man .
Would you like to get married and have children ?
We all loved Tom .
This is always the way it has been .

Drops of water glistened on the leaves of the tree after the brief downpour .
I can t tell if you re serious .

Her skirt is totally out of fashion .
According to the newspapers , he will be here today .
The car was going forward .
Can we prove it ?
She returned from a trip .
How do you like this outfit ?
The room was so dark that we could see nothing at all .
It would be great if you visited your friends in Poland someday .
I need your signature here .
Doesn t Tom live here ?

I heard a strange noise coming from Tom s room last night .
I ve been paying attention .
He speaks English better than me .
Turn it on .
This book is so difficult that I can t read it .
Tom told Mary that she should be ashamed of herself .
Will you go to Tokyo by bus ?
Do you believe in life after death ?
Tom asked me if I was angry .
It s all OK .
This belt fits me too tightly .
There were a few moments of confusion .
I don t want that kind of life for our children .
It seems to me that you are wrong .
Keep smiling .

Tom needed some time to think things over .
Today I m feeling melancholic .
Each time I see this picture , I remember my father .
The woman suspected that her son was using drugs .
Tom didn t tell Mary his secret .
It smells like a trap .
I m married .
I have nothing to live for .
We need your support .
Tom finally found a job .
Please drop by my home .
Tom s older daughter is still unmarried .
You should make an effort to stop smoking .
You may go anywhere .
We estimate the damages to be one thousand dollars .
It feels pretty unfair .
Fortunately , the fire was put out before it became too serious .
I don t drink .
The couple next door are fighting again .
I need a bath .
My father was satisfied with the result .
Tom already has a plan .
What happens at ?
How long does it take to get from here to your house on foot ?
Tom goes to Boston every year .
She has a house by the sea .
That street was very noisy .
When do you run ?
I don t think it s necessary for us to do this .

She considered his offer carefully .
Father came home .
Tom forgot to take his umbrella with him .
I was bored because I had seen the movie before .
The baby has a cute face .
I want to know who you are .
She made cookies for the children .
I could kill you .
My father has gone to America .
I can t say that to my dad .
Tom offered to lend me the money .
Nobody else offered to help .
Yesterday was a hot day .
I got acquainted with him in France .
The Spanish fired first .
You re new here .
This coffee is so hot that I can t drink it .
I love to travel .
You look depressed . Did something happen ?
I want a knife to sharpen my pencil with .
You re very beautiful .
I ve heard of him , but I don t know him personally .
A picture of the fugitive was plastered all over the newspapers .
I think you re right .
Tom looked petrified .
The bus doesn t always come on time .
He looks down on women .
Thousands of people lost their jobs .
They attempted to assassinate the president .
You re OK .
I m sorry I bothered you .
Tom doesn t know how to play golf .
I hope you can avoid all the stupid mistakes that amateurs usually make .
Let s quit here and continue tomorrow .
I cut my finger .
He ll be a good husband .
I m going to make you an offer that you can t refuse .
Get it away from me .
It s for your own safety .
Give me a ring tomorrow .
I have a dog and two cats .
Let me finish , OK ?
She asked him why he was crying , but he didn t answer .
Tom didn t know Mary had a brother .
Philosophy is not a thing one can learn in six months .
My brother fell off a tree and broke his leg .
My brother must be sick .
I left my key in my room .
His speech lasted three hours .
I don t drink beer very often .
If he hadn t been eating while driving , he wouldn t have had an accident .
As she entered the room , he sat up in his bed .
As soon as the ship began to move , he got seasick .
Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today .
Tom tried to hide his nervousness .
We need to sweep up the dust .
Don t let Tom run away .
Tell Tom I ll be there in thirty minutes .
You promised .
I couldn t do that to Tom .
She is ashamed of her old clothes .
The trouble with the world isn t that people know too little , but they know so many things that ain t so .
Tom doesn t have any classes today .
Intended for children , this is a book often read by adults .
Tom stifled a laugh .
Please write with a pen .
His career as a journalist was full of distinguished achievements .
An accident may happen at any time .
Tom and I both speak French .
I wonder where I put my glasses .
She pulled him out of the mud .
I wish I could figure out how to get my car painted without paying a lot of money .
Each year many children are kidnapped by members of their own families .
I m your sister .
I hate my job sometimes .
What s that bird called ?
She is two years older than you .
I thought we played really well .
What should I tell Tom ?
I ve got no worries .
Tom , don t leave .
I don t want to open the window .
Tom said he didn t want anything to eat .
I wish I had been with you then .
Tom is fat .
Some flowers bloom in spring and others in autumn .
She is not honest at all .
She looks happy .
I have seen the picture before .
Tom has been waiting all his life for a woman like Mary .
Frankly , I didn t have the confidence to ask Mary to have lunch with me .
Why did you say such a stupid thing ?
Suddenly , a man stepped in front of them .
I had breakfast at .
What do you have to add to to get ?
Tom was relieved to hear that .
What does it mean ?
I can t tell you everything I ve been told because I ve been told not to .

I am Japanese .
I m not interested in your opinion .
Tom told Mary he wanted a divorce .
Did you do this ?
Why don t you have some sushi ?
We must not be late .
Turn to the left .
This week I had three midterms .
It is already past five o clock .
He is a teacher .
I would like to go to the United States one day .
Wash your face .
Tom couldn t answer all of the questions .
Have you heard any news from Australia ?
I know you can help us .
Give me half .
Tom made it quite clear what he wanted .
I thought the game was over .
I m having dinner with Tom tomorrow .
What s the problem , Tom ?
Let s plan a trip to Australia .
If you need to blame someone , blame Tom and me .
How lovely !
If that accident had happened in a city , it would have caused a disaster .
Take everything .
Tom wants Mary to know that he likes her .
Tom will likely be discharged from the hospital tomorrow .
A new year always brings hope .
Can I reserve a flight to Chicago ?
Australia is a beautiful country .
Do you have a girlfriend ?
Tom is a very decent fellow .
The post office is closed .
Put on your shoes .
I mostly agree with what he said .
Tom broke his neck falling down a flight of stairs .
Tom doesn t have any idea how much Mary loves him .
How much time does she need to translate this book ?
White paint will brighten the room .
Tom s parents told him not to get involved with Mary .
It was like a dream come true .
I just got the word .
I want you to be my friend again .
I don t know what that word means .
I ll do anything to make you happy .
How much do I owe you ?
Tom graduated .
I ll phone you as soon as I get to the airport .
What is the meaning of this word ?
That s a low blow .
Would you like to eat ?
Put the box wherever you can find room for it , please .
Soldiers must follow orders .
It is a difficult problem .
Tom disappeared last month .
She was beautiful when she was young .
Which of you will come with me ?
I just found out Tom is dead .
I thought you didn t care about money .
I don t want to get married too early .
It s about time the government did something about pollution .
My mother permitted me to go to the movies .
Tom changed into his school uniform .
You re quite smart .
She argued with him and then hit him .
She made it plain that she wanted to marry him .
Tom can eat pretty much anything .
You are my hero .
I hope to build a new house next year .
Look out of the window .
When will his new novel come out ?
He s a baseball player .
I m going to go home and take a bath .
Please return the book when you have finished reading it .
Look at the blackboard .
The post office is located in the center of the town .
I m your friend .
Tom thinks he s being shadowed by a private detective .
This movie was directed by John Ford .
I have no choice but to do that .
I needed to see you in person .
Tom went to the park by himself .

This beer contains alcohol .
One man s meat is another man s poison .

Are you thinking what we re thinking ?
I don t want to get in trouble .
We apologize for the delay .
He has a perfect body .
Don t ask .
It s incredible !

Have you gone nuts ?

She acted as a guide .
I ll take care of the bill .
The point is that they are hungry .
The baby s name was Tom .

They are all hungry .
I m not optimistic .
Tom sat under a tree .

Where s this place ?
Tom and Mary are tired .
Tom is a terrorist .
No student went to the party .
Try this .
He seems to be a good guy .
The truck is gone .
What a wonderful night !
I can t believe you turned down that job .
If I were you , I d study harder .
I can t tell you how much your support means to us .
I tried , but I couldn t do it .
How big is it ?
Few students know how to read Latin .
He was busy with his homework .
There s a lot of dangerous stuff in this warehouse .
The priest gave me his blessing .
The only reason Tom went to the party was that he expected Mary to be there .
Look again .
Is it easy to install ?
This bucket leaks .
What re you thinking ?
Stop telling me what to do and mind your business .
This building is near completion .
He doesn t have a hat on .
I asked her to wait a minute .
They are collecting contributions for the church .
Tom likes trying new things .
I am leaving the books here .
I don t have Tom s number .
He catches colds very easily .
It was probably not true .
Tom shouldn t have eaten so much .
You can tell me anything .

Wait here for me .
I m angry .
Don t rely too much on your guidebook .
I don t play pool .
Go to school .
Tom and Mary are dependent on each other .
I was afraid .
Open the hatch .
Tom is trying to break the lock .
Lead is much heavier than aluminum .
I ran like lightning .
I can t make promises .
The woman over there holding a baby is my wife .
I couldn t figure out how to open the door .
How do you spell that word ?
Some of the apples in the box were rotten .
I d like to know what you re doing .
Boys , don t make any noise .
He s my best friend . It s as if he were my brother .
Tom brought this .
The girl is afraid of dogs .
The work has already begun .
They soon adjusted themselves to the new circumstances .
Tom wanted Mary to understand why he couldn t live with her .
Do you want to do this now ?
Why did Tom call you ?
She refused his offer .
The girl imagines that she is a doctor .
What is the president s plan ?
May I say something ?
Tom is our employee .
She showed me her room .
A lot of people are interested in camping .
Do you know when Tom got his driver s license ?
She spoke to me in Spanish .
They blamed the driver for the accident .
He embezzled public money .
They did everything in order to make money .
Tom found what he was looking for .
We should try to treat everybody with justice .
Tom said he doesn t even want to think about it .
She begged him to stay .
Well , that s a big surprise .
Tom won t go even if he s invited .
I haven t seen you in here before .
Tom explained the schedule to Mary .
Sorry . I must ve dialed the wrong number .
Good things come in small packages .
The world is a big place .
Let s watch a movie .
I slept with my clothes on .
I like dogs better than cats .
All you have to do is sweep the floor .
I know what I ll do .
After the lightning , came the thunder .
You said I was a liar .
Tom looks worried and confused .
I showed her my room .
Her cheeks turned red .
Tom opened a can of tuna fish .
They welcomed me warmly , so I felt at home .

My brother hung the picture upside down .
Mary hates her job for many reasons .
He lost his temper and hit the boy .
I have never dared to speak to her .
I don t want to discuss this anymore .
He is skating .
Tom couldn t tell Mary everything he knew .
Do I need to be here tomorrow ?
Now he has nothing to live for .
I got my ears pierced .
He thinks he knows everything .
It was fine all day .
Where does that bus go ?
What she said did not make sense .
We set a trap to catch a fox .
I drove Tom s Prius once .
Take off your socks , please .
I hope that I ll see her .
We have a party this evening .
The guard thought they were joking until he saw their guns .
Chances are that I will be late for work .
We need to do this report again .
Tom lied to Mary about everything .
My younger brother swims every day in the summer .
