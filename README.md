## SQuAD 2.0 Transfomerd-based model error analysis
The task of Question Answering has gained prominence in the past few decades for testing the ability of machines to understand natural language. And as computational resources are more available nowadays, model like BERT, ALBERT are proposed and have reach the SOTA performance on Question Answering area. In this code, we attempt to understand and compare the existing transformer-based model on Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) by performing quantitative as well as qualitative analysis of the results attained by each of them.
